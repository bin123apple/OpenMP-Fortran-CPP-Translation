# Fortran-CPP-HPC-code-translation-dataset

This repository contains training and testing dataset and a simple test script.

We collect data form three different source: 

[Polybench](https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~pouchet.2/software/polybench/)

[NAS Parallel Benchmarks](https://www.nas.nasa.gov/software/npb.html)

[dataracebench](https://github.com/LLNL/dataracebench)

You can also download the dataset from : [My Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Bin12345/HPC_Fortran_CPP)

Here is one data pair example:

We will add more data pairs in the future and will add a new "nature language" column for code generation task.
